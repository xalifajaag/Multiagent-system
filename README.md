# Multiagent-system
It's about designing the electrical grid of a smart neighbourhood using MAS by developing the controller of smart homes and electric vehicles. The developed model considers the integration of renewable energy sources and an energy storage system in the smart homes. We used the smart python Agent development environment (SPADE) module.
